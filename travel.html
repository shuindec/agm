                <p style="width: 50%; float: left; padding: 2em;">At La Trobe University, we are paying more attention about arts and creative things.<br>
                <br>
                The Agora contains its Cinema can seat 170 attendees and the Agora Theatre can seat 450. Both are located in the Agora precinct at the centre of campus.<br>
                We have works by regional artists, contemporary art, and even those that combine elements from both cultures.<br><br>
                
                Besides, The art gallery is accessible to the community, just as our library is, so you may stop by and take in the amazing and unusual paintings and sculptures that are on show.<br>
                If you wish to conduct your own art show, please come to our gallery as we occasionally host various art exhibitions.<br>

                <p style="width: 50%; float: left; padding: 2em;">As a project for the preservation and maintenance of indigenous flora and animals, the Nangak Tamboree Wildlife Sanctuary was established in 1967.<br><br>

                    La Trobe University and Trust for Nature reached an agreement in 2012 to erect a Conservation Covenant on the property. For the natural vegetation, including the habitat for plants and wildlife, to be permanently protected, a covenant must be written on the title of the land.<br><br>
                    
                    The Sanctuary, Gresswell Habitat Link, and Gresswell Forest are all connected by this eco-corridor, which also passes via Bundoora Campus and Darebin Creek in the south. 
                    Nangak Tamboree will design a warm, welcoming, and culturally sensitive area that safeguards our wildlife and fosters community interaction.
